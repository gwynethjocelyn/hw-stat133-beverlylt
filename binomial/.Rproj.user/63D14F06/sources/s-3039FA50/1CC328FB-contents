## Overview
The `binomial` package provides functions to properly calculate a binomial distribution: whether the probability or more specific characteristics such as it mean. It mainly consists of:
- `bin_variable()` is a random variable of the binomial distribution.
- `bin_choose()` gives the number of combinations in which a certain number of success(es) happen in a certain number of trials.
- `bin_probability()` calculates the probability certain number of success(es) happen in the specified number of trials.
- `bin_distribution()` calculates the distribution of the probability of all the possible number of success(es) given the number of trials.
- `bin_cumulative()` calculates the distribution and the accumulated probability from the previous number of success(es).
- `plot()` would plot the histogram of the `bin_distribution()` function or graph the `bin_cumulative()` success(es) against the cumulative probabilities.
- `summary()` would give a summary of the `bin_variable()` function - such as it parameters and measurements.

## In addition:
The `binomial` package also offers a closer look to the properties of a binomial distribution, of which includes:
-`bin_mean()` which calculates the mean of the binomial distribution.
-`bin_variance()` which calculates the variance of the binomial distribution.
-`bin_mode()` which calculates the mode of the binomial distribution.
-`bin_skewness()` which calculates the skewness of the binomial distribution.
-`bin_kurtosis()` which calculates the kurtosis of the binomial distribution.

## Motivation
This package helps users to more easily calculate properties of the binomial distribution.

## Usage
``` r
library(binomial)
